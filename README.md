# Hackhub, built on lens

The social network has two types of users, participants who can find other participants through filters and contact them from the page itself, on the other hand, organizations can create events to be displayed from the portal and hackers are aware of upcoming events that will see all the information available. Within the functionalities you can make filters to search for a hacker with skills, previous participations, prizes won in hackathons and other important data that are essential to form a good team. Also, there is a general chat where people can write that they are looking for someone for their team, or a team to join, but the magic is that when they send the message, the algorithm automatically finds other similar messages that can satisfy their need whether they have found a person or a team.

## How it's Made

We used a variety of technologies in hackhub. It is built on top of Ethereum, and Polygon. We use Lens profiles for people to build their onchain credentials, and for communication between users, you are able to use Push Protocol. We used React.js for the frontend. Solidity for the payment processing.
